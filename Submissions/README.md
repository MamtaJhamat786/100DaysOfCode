### First of all, fork and clone the 100DaysOfCode repository. Once you are set(please reach out to me or anyone in the class that may help you set this up),  you'll see the following folder structure:

100DaysOfCode (directory)

-> Challenges (directory)

-> Submissions

(other files)

### Any and all challenge submissions should first create a folder with the folder name being the exact as is your github handle. For example if my profile is located is github.com/manish-ee then the folder I would create is manish-ee under the submissions directory. 

### Under that directory, your submission files will be in any programming language and extension are you prefer, the only other condition being that the file name should hint towards what Challenge it is trying to solve.

#### Ideal names for solution files would be: SolutionDay1.java, SolutionDay1.rb, SolutionDay1.cpp, etc.

### Therefore, your project folder would now start to look like:
100DaysOfCode (directory)

-> Challenges (directory)

------> ChallengeDay1

------> ChallengeDay2

-> Submissions

------> manish-ee

------------> SolutionDay1.java


### Finally, once your solution is ready, feel free to make a pull request(again, please seek someone that can help you with fundamental github issues or follow tutorials on udemy or youtube).
